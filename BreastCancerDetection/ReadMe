Problem Definition

Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed among U.S. women (excluding skin cancers) with about 252,710 new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2017. It is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the U.S., after lung cancer; 40,610 women in the U.S. are expected to die from this disease in 2017 [2]. Currently, the most used techniques to detect breast cancer in early stages are: Mammography (63% to 97% correctness), FNA (Fine Needle Aspiration) with visual interpretation (65% to 98% correctness) and surgical biopsy (approximately 100% correctness). Therefore,mammography and FNA with visual interpretation correctness varies widely, and the surgical biopsy, although reliable,is invasive and costly [3]. Our breast cancer wisconsin dataset have 32 features that are computed from a digitized image of a Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. I use classification and regression algorithms to find out the accuracy. 

List of methods

I will implement following methods for classification and regression to compare the accuracy of the dataset.
  Logistic Regression
  Linear Regression
  KNN 
  Deep Learning (Neural Networks)
  SVM
  Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
  Decision Tree
  Linear Discriminant Analysis
  Random Forests

Description of Data
I am using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set - Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant from Kaggle [1]. 

This dataset consists of 32 features and 569 patients records. 
  ID number
  Diagnosis : The diagnosis of breast tissues (M = malignant, B = benign)
  Radius_mean :mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
  Texture_mean : standard deviation of gray-scale values
  Perimeter_mean : mean size of the core tumor
  Area_mean
  Smoothness_mean : mean of local variation in radius lengths
  Compactness_mean : mean of perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
  Concavity_mean : mean of severity of concave portions of the contour
  concave points_mean : mean for number of concave portions of the contour
  Symmetry_mean
  Fractal_dimension_mean : mean for "coastline approximation" - 1
  Radius_se :standard error for the mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
  Texture_se : standard error for standard deviation of gray-scale values
  Perimeter_se
  Area_se
  Smoothness_se : standard error for local variation in radius lengths
  Compactness_se : standard error for perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
  Concavity_se : standard error for severity of concave portions of the contour
  concave points_se : standard error for number of concave portions of the contour
  Symmetry_se
  Fractal_dimension_se : standard error for "coastline approximation" - 1
  Radius_worst : "worst" or largest mean value for mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
  Texture_worst : "worst" or largest mean value for standard deviation of gray-scale values
  Perimeter_worst
  Area_worst
  Smoothness_worst : "worst" or largest mean value for local variation in radius lengths
  Compactness_worst : "worst" or largest mean value for perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
  Concavity_worst : "worst" or largest mean value for severity of concave portions of the contour
  concave points_worst : "worst" or largest mean value for number of concave portions of the contour

Experiment Design
 compare the accuracy of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set Predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant.  I am use the K-Fold Cross Validation for our dataset to detect the TPR and FPR to find out the ROC curve and AUC for the comparison of above mentioned algorithms.
